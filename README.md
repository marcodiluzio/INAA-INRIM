# INAA-INRIM
GUM compliant uncertainty budget builder for relative and k0-standardization Neutron Activation Analysis measurements.


This software is developed as an aid for analysts to perform INAA measurement (with application of either relative and k0 method) and a support to compile uncertainty budgets.
It was built from the merging of two separate projects (k0-INRIM and Rel-INRIM) concerning the application of k0 and relative methods but sharing various features and modelizations.
The produced uncertainty budgets are standalone and exportable in Microsoft Excel format; it could take into account measurement performed on different emissions, samples and irradiation.

Source code is written in Python 3.6
